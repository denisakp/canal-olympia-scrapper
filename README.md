# Canal Olympia Scrapping API 
    

## What the Project Does

This project is a Python adaptation of the original 
[idea](https://github.com/NemesisX1/canal_olympia_scrapping_api) written in TypeScript. It is intended to allow you to scrape data from the Canal Olympia [official site](https://www.canalolympia.com/) and
provides the data in JSON format. This JSON-formatted data can be used for various purposes, including but not limited
to:

- Extracting information about events, schedules, or listings from Canal Olympia's website.
- Analyzing and visualizing the data for insights or reports.
- Creating custom applications that leverage the scraped data.
- Automating the retrieval of data from Canal Olympia's site for regular updates or notifications.

The scraped data can include details such as movies names, dates, times, locations, descriptions, and any other
relevant information available on the official site. This data is then structured in a machine-readable JSON format,
making it easy to work with in different programming environments and applications.
